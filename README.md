# Parallel-Computing

## Matrix Multpilcation Using MPI
The goal of the first project was to write a parallel algorithm using MPI to multiply two matrices AxB to produce the result in matrix C.

The matrix size was 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 and was tested to make sure have the correct answer, and the code was ran using 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 processors.

The following parameters were calculated and plotted 
1. Speedup
2. Utilization Rate

## Bubble Sort Using MPI
The goal of the second project was to write a parallel algorithm using MPI that will parallelize the bubble sort algorithm, the array sorted 1024 random elements

The following parameters were calculated and plotted 
1. Speedup
2. Utilization Rate

## Matrix Multpilcation Using UPC
The goal of the final project was to write a parallel algorithm using UPC to multiply two matrices AxB to produce the result in matrix C.

The matrix size was 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 and was tested to make sure have the correct answer, and the code was ran using 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 threads.

The following parameters were calculated and plotted 
1. Speedup
2. Utilization Rate
